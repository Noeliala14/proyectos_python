# Python Learning Journey 🚀
This repository contains my progress in Python programming, focusing on logic, data structures, and GUI development.

## 📁 Projects Included

## 1. Bubble Blaster (Cazaburbujas) 🫧
A graphical game developed using the `tkinter` library. This project helped me understand:
* **Event Handling:** Capturing keyboard input to move objects.
* **Game Loops:** Managing real-time updates and object movements.
* **Collision Logic:** Using coordinate geometry to detect interactions between objects.
* **Mathematical Implementation:** Working with coordinate systems and the `math` library.

#### **How to Play:**
1. Run `bubble_blaster.py`.
2. Use the **Arrow Keys** (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the red submarine.
3. Pop as many bubbles as you can before the **30-second timer** runs out!
